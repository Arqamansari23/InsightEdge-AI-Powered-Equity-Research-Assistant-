While it mentions cash balances and borrowing limits, it lacks the detailed income statement and balance sheet information necessary for these calculations.  Therefore, a quantitative analysis of cash flow risks cannot be performed.\\n\\nThe report *indirectly* alludes to cash flow risks by:\\n\\n* **Mentioning liquidity risk:** The report discusses the company's ability to meet short-term obligations.  While it states that management believes liquidity risk is insignificant based on available borrowing limits and cash balances, this is a qualitative assessment, not a quantitative measure of cash flow risk.  The actual cash flow situation could be more precarious than the assessment suggests.\\n\\n* **Highlighting interest rate risk:** The company's exposure to variable interest rates on borrowings implies a risk of increased interest expense, potentially impacting cash flows if interest rates rise significantly.  The report mentions prepayment options as a mitigation strategy, but the effectiveness of this strategy depends on the magnitude of interest rate increases and the associated prepayment penalties.\\n\\n* **Discussing raw material price fluctuations:**  Changes in cotton and yarn prices directly affect the company's cost of goods sold, which in turn impacts its profitability and ultimately its cash flow.  The report mentions stock management as a mitigation strategy, but this only partially addresses the risk.  Significant price increases could still negatively affect cash flow.\\n\\nIn summary, while the report doesn't provide the numerical data to calculate specific cash flow risk metrics, it qualitatively identifies several factors that could negatively impact the company's cash flow, including interest rate fluctuations, raw material price volatility, and the potential for liquidity issues despite management's assessment.  A more comprehensive financial analysis with detailed income statement and balance sheet data would be needed for a precise quantification of these risks.\\n\",\n",

This risk is exacerbated by changes in import policies and utility rates.\\n\\n* **Currency risk:** The company is exposed to foreign currency risk due to international transactions (exports and imports). Fluctuations in exchange rates directly affect the profitability of these transactions.\\n\\n* **Markup risk:** Changes in markup rates (likely interest rates) affect the company's borrowing costs and overall financial performance.\\n\\n* **Geopolitical risk:**  The company acknowledges the risk of a decline in export sales due to geopolitical instability and reduced global demand.  This highlights the vulnerability of the company to international events beyond its direct control.\\n\\n* **Potential decline in export sales:** This is linked to both geopolitical risk and shifts in global demand, impacting a significant portion of the company's revenue.\\n\\n\\nThe company employs various mitigation strategies, including stock management, optimizing working capital, and using financial instruments like forward contracts to manage some of these risks.
