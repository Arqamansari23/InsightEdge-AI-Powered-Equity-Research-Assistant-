				 *Income Statement Analysis* 




*Revenue:*
The company's net sales revenue for the past six years (2019-2024) are as follows (in Rs. million):

* **2019:** 13,963
* **2020:** 15,333
* **2021:** 27,263
* **2022:** 36,133
* **2023:** 40,071
* **2024:** 44,753

**Analysis:**

The revenue shows a generally increasing trend from 2019 to 2024, with some fluctuations.  There was a significant jump in revenue in 2021 and continued growth, although the rate of growth slowed in later years.

**Impact on Investors:**

This increasing revenue trend is generally positive for investors.  Higher revenue suggests the company is growing and potentially more profitable.  However, investors should also consider factors like profit margins, expenses, and overall profitability to get a complete picture of the company's financial health and its future prospects.  A slowing growth rate, as seen in the later years, might warrant further investigation into the underlying reasons.  Investors would want to understand if this is a temporary slowdown or a sign of a longer-term trend.



*COCS (Cost of good sold ):*
The provided text does not contain the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for previous years.  Therefore, I cannot answer your question about the trend of COGS over time or its effect on investors.  The only COGS figures available are for the year ending June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, and these are presented within a larger table detailing depreciation charges.  More complete financial statements are needed to provide the requested analysis.



*Gross profit:*
The gross profit of Gul Ahmed Textile Mills Limited for the past five years is as follows (in Rs. million):

* **2024:** 76,545
* **2023:** 62,588
* **2022:** 59,669
* **2021:** 46,749
* **2020:** 38,914
* **2019:** 30,104


**Analysis:**

The gross profit has been consistently increasing over the past five years.  This is a positive trend indicating growth in the company's core business operations.  The increase is substantial, showing a significant improvement in profitability before considering operating expenses.

**Impact on Investors:**

A consistently increasing gross profit is generally viewed favorably by investors. It suggests that the company is effectively managing its production costs and pricing strategies, leading to higher margins. This increased profitability can translate into higher dividends, increased share value, and greater investor confidence.  However, investors should also consider other factors like operating expenses, debt levels, and overall market conditions before making investment decisions.  A solely positive gross profit trend doesn't guarantee overall company success.



*Total Operating Expence:*
The provided text does not contain a breakdown of operating expenses for previous years.  Therefore, I cannot answer your question about the total operating expenses over time or provide an analysis of their trend.  The financial highlights only show high-level profitability figures (sales, gross profit, profit before and after tax).  More detailed income statement information is needed to calculate and analyze operating expenses.



*Operating Profit:*
The provided text does not contain a complete Profit & Loss statement showing operating profit figures for previous years.  Therefore, I cannot answer your question about the trend in operating profit or its effect on investors.  The document only gives snippets of financial data and does not provide the necessary information to calculate or analyze operating profit over time.



*Net Profit:*
The provided text gives the profit after tax (net profit) in Rs. Million for the years:

* **2024:** 4,728
* **2023:** 3,986
* **2022:** 8,862
* **2021:** 4,425
* **2020:** (479)
* **2019:** (479)


**Analysis:**

Net profit shows significant fluctuation over the years.  There was a loss in 2019 and 2020.  A substantial increase was seen in 2022 (Rs. 8,862 million), followed by a decrease in 2023 and a further decrease in 2024.

**Effect on Investors:**

Fluctuating net profit creates uncertainty for investors.  A consistently increasing net profit generally attracts investors as it signals growth and potential for higher returns (dividends and share price appreciation). Conversely, decreasing or negative net profit can lead to decreased investor confidence, potentially causing share prices to fall and making it harder to attract new investment.  The large increase in 2022 might have initially boosted investor sentiment, but the subsequent declines would likely cause concern.  Investors would want to understand the reasons behind these fluctuations before making investment decisions.



				*Ratio Analysis*


*Liquidity Ratio Analysis*


Current Ratio and Quick Ratio
Here's a summary of the Current Ratio and Quick/Acid Test Ratio for Gul Ahmed Textile Mills Limited over the years, followed by a short analysis:


**Current Ratio:**

* **2019:** 1.16
* **2020:** 1.02
* **2021:** 1.12
* **2022:** 1.15
* **2023:** 1.11
* **2024:** 1.08

**Quick/Acid Test Ratio:**

* **2019:** 0.39
* **2020:** 0.29
* **2021:** 0.57
* **2022:** 0.55
* **2023:** 0.47
* **2024:** 0.41


**Analysis:**

The current ratio fluctuates between 1.02 and 1.16 over the period, showing some instability in the company's short-term liquidity.  There's no clear upward or downward trend; it shows some improvement after 2020 but a slight decline in the most recent year.

The quick ratio shows a similar pattern of fluctuation, ranging from 0.29 to 0.57.  Like the current ratio, it doesn't exhibit a consistent increasing or decreasing trend.  The quick ratio is generally lower than the current ratio, indicating that a significant portion of current assets is tied up in inventory.

**Impact on Investors:**

Both ratios are indicators of a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations.  A decreasing current ratio or quick ratio might signal a potential liquidity problem, which could concern investors.  Conversely, a consistently improving ratio would generally be viewed favorably, suggesting the company is better positioned to handle its short-term debts.  However, the fluctuations observed in both ratios for Gul Ahmed Textile Mills Limited suggest some variability in the company's short-term liquidity management.  Investors should consider these fluctuations in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative factors before making investment decisions.



*Laverage Ratio Analysis*


Debt-to-Equity Ratio and Interest Coverage Ratio:
Based on the provided text, here's the information you requested:


**Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**

* **2019:** Not explicitly stated, but the gearing ratio (which is similar) was 65.41%.
* **2020:**  Not explicitly stated, but the gearing ratio was 73.81%.
* **2021:** Not explicitly stated, but the gearing ratio was 64.80%.
* **2022:** Not explicitly stated, but the gearing ratio was 61.78%.
* **2023:** Not explicitly stated, but the gearing ratio was 57.14%.
* **2024:** 57.20%


**Interest Coverage Ratio:**

* **2019:** 3.72 times
* **2020:** 0.96 times
* **2021:** 3.86 times
* **2022:** 4.92 times
* **2023:** 2.11 times
* **2024:** 2.20 times


**Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuations in both the debt-to-equity ratio and the interest coverage ratio over the years.  The gearing ratio (a close proxy for the debt-to-equity ratio) shows a general downward trend from 2020 to 2024, indicating a reduction in the company's reliance on debt financing relative to equity.  However, there was a significant increase in 2020.  The interest coverage ratio also fluctuates, showing periods of both improvement and decline in the company's ability to cover its interest expenses with its earnings.

**Effect on Investors:**

* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** A high debt-to-equity ratio generally indicates higher financial risk for investors.  A decrease in this ratio (as seen in the trend from 2020 to 2024, excluding the 2020 spike) suggests reduced risk, potentially making the company more attractive to investors who are risk-averse. Conversely, a high ratio (like in 2020) could signal increased risk of default and might deter some investors.

* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** A higher interest


*Investor Profitibility Ratio*


Net Profit Margin, ROE, ROA, and EPS:
The provided annual report gives data for Net Profit Margin, Return on Equity (ROE), and Earnings Per Share (EPS).  Return on Assets (ROA) is not explicitly provided.  Therefore, I cannot calculate ROA.

**Trends:**

* **Net Profit Margin:**  The net profit margin has fluctuated significantly over the years. It was high in 2022 (8.84%), then dropped sharply in 2023 (3.56%) and 2020 (-0.89%), before recovering slightly in 2024 (3.30%).

* **Return on Equity (ROE):** The ROE also shows volatility.  It was very high in 2022 (27.96%), decreased in 2023 (10.46%), and further decreased in 2020 (-3.27%), before showing a modest increase in 2024 (11.15%).

* **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** EPS followed a similar pattern to the Net Profit Margin and ROE, with a peak in 2022 (11.97), a significant drop in 2020 (-1.12), and a recovery in 2024 (6.39).


**Analysis:**

The Net Profit Margin, ROE, and EPS all exhibit considerable year-to-year variability.  There's no consistent upward or downward trend.  The sharp declines in 2020 suggest a period of significant financial difficulty for the company.  The subsequent recovery in 2024 is positive but needs further observation to determine if it's sustainable.

**Investor Impact:**

* **Decreasing Net Profit Margin, ROE, and EPS:**  Decreases in these metrics signal reduced profitability and shareholder returns.  This would likely lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially causing a drop in the company's share price and making it harder to attract new investment.

* **Increasing Net Profit Margin, ROE, and EPS:** Increases indicate improved profitability and higher returns for shareholders. This would generally boost investor confidence, potentially leading to a rise in the share price and increased investor interest.

**Important Note:**  The volatility observed in these key financial indicators suggests that investors should carefully analyze the underlying reasons for these fluctuations before making investment decisions.  A deeper dive


				Major Cash Flow Risks:
The annual report identifies liquidity risk as a major cash flow risk.  The report states that this is the risk of the company encountering difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities when they fall due.  However, management believes this risk is insignificant due to sufficient cash on hand and available borrowing limits.  The report provides details on available borrowing limits and cash balances to support this assessment.



				*Operational Risks*
The annual report identifies the following key operational risks:

1.  **Production breakdown due to mechanical failure:** This risk stems from internal factors and is considered low in likelihood and magnitude, but high in impact on capital and strategic objectives.  Mitigation involves preventive maintenance, equipment upgrades, redundancy, buffer capacity, and employee training.

2.  **HSE (Health, Safety, and Environment) threats to employees, assets, and inventory:** This internal risk is considered medium in likelihood and magnitude, with high impact. Mitigation strategies include comprehensive HSE policies, safety training, safety equipment, infrastructure investment, and quarterly mock evacuation drills.

3.  **Employee turnover:** This internal risk is considered medium in likelihood and magnitude, with medium impact.  Mitigation involves competitive compensation and benefits, career development opportunities, employee engagement, and effective training and onboarding programs.



				*Major Market Risks*
The company's major market risks are currency risk and markup risk.  The annual report does not detail other price risks beyond mentioning the risk of changes in the fair value of investments in mutual funds due to changes in net asset value.



				*Governance And Regulatory Risks*:
The annual report highlights the following key governance and regulatory risks:

**1. Political and Economic Uncertainty:**  Changes in government policies pose a significant risk.  The company mitigates this by maintaining open communication with government and political institutions to influence decisions and prepare for regulatory changes.

**2. Compliance with Laws and Regulations:** The report emphasizes the importance of complying with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.  It mentions that penalties for violations can be severe, advising directors and employees to seek legal counsel when necessary.  The company aims to maintain a constructive relationship with regulators to foster mutual trust and understanding.

The report also mentions that the company's risk management philosophy, governance, and key risks and opportunities are detailed on pages 55-60, and risk management is further discussed on page 57.  However, the provided text does not contain the specifics from those pages.
